# 2p4s
## A wind generator based on granular synthesis (GMU)
2p4s (2 to the power 4 seasons) is a Max for Live device based on perceptual approach developed at [GMEM](https://github.com/gmem-cncm) by [Matfayt](https://github.com/Matfayt) and [SuhtrA](https://github.com/SuhtrA). You'll have access to an interpolated set of parameters only using a slider exploring the 4 french season. 

The Max for Live device is based on the [GMU Package](https://github.com/gmem-cncm/GMU) (GMEM Microsound Universe), a Max/MSP Package developed at GMEM.
Open the patch to change the pattrstorage interpolation parameters if you want to. However, it is curently calibrated to generate wind according to the seasons displayed !

## Requirements
- Ableton Live
- [GMU Package](https://github.com/gmem-cncm/GMU)
